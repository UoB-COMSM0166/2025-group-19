# Game Design Ideas

## **Idea 1:** 
- Change the speed of the ball to increase difficulty.
- The ball will become invisible for 1 second.
- In a particular level, the ball is completely invisible. When it hits the wall or block, there will be fireworks or flashes.
- Slow motion effect during specific events.
- The ball will disappear from one block and randomly reappear from another block.
- Blocks can move, creating additional challenges.

## **Idea 2:** 
- Black Hole: Balls will disappear upon entering the black hole.
- Blocks are designed in a cartoon style.
- Functional Block: Paddle can be controlled in reverse direction.
- Gravity changes: Ball's gravity will make it move upwards instead of falling.
- The blocks are replaced with enemies. Enemies will shoot fire.

## **Idea 3:** 
- Level: Similar to Tetris, start with 3 rows. If not cleared within 10 seconds, an additional row will be added. If the total exceeds 20 rows, the game is lost.
- Function: Super Star Ball, which will destroy everything. It ignores boundaries and wonâ€™t fall off the screen.

## **Idea 4:** 
- Particular blocks will float away like balloons when hit. Players must destroy them before they float out of the screen.

## **Idea 5:** 
- Added power-ups.
  - **Magnetism:** Paddle can collect power-ups from a distance.
  - **Bomb:** Next hit by the ball blows up a set area of blocks.
  - **Row Clear:** The next hit by the ball clears an entire row instead of a single block.

## **Game Overview**

Our game is inspired by the classic block breaker game. In its traditional form, a ball bounces around the screen, breaking blocks upon impact. The player controls a paddle at the bottom, ensuring the ball stays in play while aiming to clear all the blocks. Our version introduces varying difficulty levels, each with unique mechanics. For example, some levels will feature changing ball speeds when specific blocks are destroyed, moving blocks, changing ball size, and other dynamic challenges to keep the gameplay engaging and unpredictable.
