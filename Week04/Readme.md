- **Encouraging users to jog more instead of driving**

| **Stakeholder**    | **User Story**                                                                                  | **Requirement**                                                                                                   |

| **User**           | As a user, I want to have a jogging schedule based on the weather, so that I don’t have to go jogging on a wet day. | Given the weather forecast, when I plan my jogging session, then the app will notify me if it's not suitable due to rain. |
| **User**           | As a user, I want the app to generate a safe route based on my address.                         | Given I have provided my current location to the app, when I go to work, then the app will suggest a safe route with minimal traffic and good conditions. |
| **User**           | As a user, I want to jog based on my preferences for the level of exercise I want.              | Given I don’t want to exercise that much, when I go to work, then the app will give me different route options with varying levels of jogging involved. |
| **User**           | As a user, I want a route with less interaction with traffic and safer areas.                   | Given that it’s possible to jog the entire distance from home to work, the app will suggest the safest route possible, factoring in factors like traffic and crime rates. |
| **User**           | As a user, I want to avoid disruptions when jogging.                                             | Given I have started jogging, when there is a construction along the fastest jogging route, then the app will automatically avoid the site and give an alternative. |
| **User**           | As a user, I want feedback from the app on my jogging activity.                                  | Given I finish jogging, when I complete the route, then the app will provide feedback on my distance, speed, and calories burned. |
| **CEO**            | As a CEO, I want my app to be the top choice for jogging and exercise-related activities.        | Given the increasing demand for fitness apps, when users choose an app for jogging, then the app will have features that make it stand out, such as personalized routes and weather-based suggestions. |
| **Environmentalist**| As an environmentalist, I want the app to promote eco-friendly transportation options.         | Given the app’s route suggestions, when I plan my jogging routes, then the app will encourage more users to opt for walking or jogging instead of driving. |

## Game Discussion

### Epic
- **Creating an intriguing and various game experience.**
- **Let our kids play a game without violence.**
- **Try to learn from failure and frustrations.**
- **Accessible to visually impaired (maybe support for accessible controllers if we have time to deal with that).**
- **Educational.**

| **Stakeholder**       | **User Story**                                                                                  | **Requirement**                                                                                                   | **Epic** |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Parents**           | As a parent, I want to make sure that my kids are playing appropriate games, so that they don’t neglect their studies or get addicted to video games. | Given the kid mode is on, when kids play the game, then the game will kick them out if they play longer than the time limit. | **Let our kids play a game without violence** |
| **Visually Impaired User** | As a visually impaired or colour blind user, I want accessible features such as larger texts or easily recognisable blocks, so that I can play the game with minimal trouble. | Given I am in colour blind mode, when I play, then blocks with special effects will be designated by shapes instead of colours. | **Accessible to visually impaired** |
| **Physics Teacher**   | As a physics teacher/professor, I want to make use of the game mechanics and physics in an educational setting, so that my students have a more visual and interesting way to learn about physics. | Given I want to show the concept of momentum to kids, when the kids are in the game, then there can be play back so that the motion can be observed in more detail (maximized with angles, velocity, etc shown). | **Educational** |
| **Parents & Physics Teachers** | As parents and physics teachers, I want my kids or students to play the game without violence. | Given I want to let my kids know that it would be entertaining with physical game experience. | **Let our kids play a game without violence** |
| **Parents**           | As parents, I want my children to train their focus and reaction speed.                          | Given the increasing difficulty of levels, when the speed of the board increases, then the child needs to focus more and react fast to complete the level. | **Try to learn from failure and frustrations** |
| **Positive Reinforcer** | As a person who does better with positive encouragement, I want there to be a reward system, so that I’m more motivated to keep playing and complete harder levels. | Given there is a completion ladder, when a certain level is completed/treshold is met, then rewards such as a new background theme or user icon will be granted. | **Try to learn from failure and frustrations** |
| **User**              | As a user, I want certain bricks to drop power-up, such as double points or paddle expansion, to add variety to the game. | Given certain bricks contain a specific power-up, when the players break one of these bricks, then the corresponding power-up, such as double points or paddle expansion, will drop for the player to collect. | **Creating an intriguing and various game experience** |
| **Speedrun Competitor** | As a speedrun competitor, I want to have different records to pass the game.                     | Given the game has time trials, when I play the game, then I can try to beat my previous records and climb the leaderboard. | **Creating an intriguing and various game experience** |
