# Requirements

## 1. Epics
- **Creating an intriguing and various game experience.**
- **Let our kids play a game without violence.**
- **Try to learn from failure and frustrations.**
- **Accessible to visually impaired (maybe support for accessible controllers if we have time to deal with that).**
- **Educational.**

## 2. User Stories & Requirements

| **Stakeholder**            | **User Story**                                                                                     | **Requirement**                                                                                                             | **Epic** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Parents**                | As a parent, I want to make sure that my kids are playing appropriate games, so that they don’t neglect their studies or get addicted to video games. | Given the kid mode is on, when kids play the game, then the game will kick them out if they play longer than the time limit. | **Let our kids play a game without violence** |
| **Visually Impaired User** | As a visually impaired or colour blind user, I want accessible features such as larger texts or easily recognisable blocks, so that I can play the game with minimal trouble. | Given I am in colour blind mode, when I play, then blocks with special effects will be designated by shapes instead of colours. | **Accessible to visually impaired** |
| **Physics Teacher**        | As a physics teacher/professor, I want to make use of the game mechanics and physics in an educational setting, so that my students have a more visual and interesting way to learn about physics. | Given I want to show the concept of momentum to kids, when the kids are in the game, then there can be playback so that the motion can be observed in more detail (maximized with angles, velocity, etc shown). | **Educational** |
| **Parents & Physics Teachers** | As parents and physics teachers, I want my kids or students to play the game without violence. | Given I want to let my kids know that it would be entertaining with physical game experience. | **Let our kids play a game without violence** |
| **Parents**                | As parents, I want my children to train their focus and reaction speed.                          | Given the increasing difficulty of levels, when the speed of the board increases, then the child needs to focus more and react fast to complete the level. | **Try to learn from failure and frustrations** |
| **Positive Reinforcer**    | As a person who does better with positive encouragement, I want there to be a reward system, so that I’m more motivated to keep playing and complete harder levels. | Given there is a completion ladder, when a certain level is completed/threshold is met, then rewards such as a new background theme or user icon will be granted. | **Try to learn from failure and frustrations** |
| **User**                   | As a user, I want certain bricks to drop power-ups, such as double points or paddle expansion, to add variety to the game. | Given certain bricks contain a specific power-up, when the players break one of these bricks, then the corresponding power-up, such as double points or paddle expansion, will drop for the player to collect. | **Creating an intriguing and various game experience** |
| **Speedrun Competitor**    | As a speedrun competitor, I want to have different records to pass the game.                     | Given the game has time trials, when I play the game, then I can try to beat my previous records and climb the leaderboard. | **Creating an intriguing and various game experience** |

## 3. Reflection
Through the process of defining epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria, our team gained a clearer understanding of the features and potential impact of our game. Initially, our focus was on creating an engaging experience, but as we refined our user stories, we realised that our game could also have an educational purpose. Identifying physics teachers as potential users led us to consider new features, such as playback tools to help visualise concepts like momentum.

Writing out user stories helped us think more deeply about our audience. We recognised that different users—children, parents, educators, and even speedrun competitors—have different needs. For instance, parents became an important stakeholder group, making us consider concerns such as screen time limits and non-violent gameplay. This led to features like kid mode, which ensures children do not play excessively.

Additionally, we acknowledged accessibility concerns, such as designing for visually impaired users. Features like shape-based indicators instead of colour coding were identified as ways to make the game more inclusive.

One challenge we recognised was the potential for game addiction in younger players. While we want to create a rewarding and immersive experience, it’s also important to balance engagement with healthy play habits. This awareness influenced some of our design decisions, such as implementing positive reinforcement systems while still setting limits.

Overall, this exercise helped us solidify our vision, ensuring our game is not just fun but also inclusive, educational, and responsible.
