| **User**           | As a user, I want to have a jogging schedule based on the weather, so that I don’t have to go jogging on a wet day. | Given the weather forecast, when I plan my jogging session, then the app will notify me if it's not suitable due to rain. |
| **User**           | As a user, I want the app to generate a safe route based on my address.                         | Given I have provided my current location to the app, when I go to work, then the app will suggest a safe route with minimal traffic and good conditions. |
| **User**           | As a user, I want to jog based on my preferences for the level of exercise I want.              | Given I don’t want to exercise that much, when I go to work, then the app will give me different route options with varying levels of jogging involved. |
| **User**           | As a user, I want a route with less interaction with traffic and safer areas.                   | Given that it’s possible to jog the entire distance from home to work, the app will suggest the safest route possible, factoring in factors like traffic and crime rates. |
| **User**           | As a user, I want to avoid disruptions when jogging.                                             | Given I have started jogging, when there is a construction along the fastest jogging route, then the app will automatically avoid the site and give an alternative. |
| **User**           | As a user, I want feedback from the app on my jogging activity.                                  | Given I finish jogging, when I complete the route, then the app will provide feedback on my distance, speed, and calories burned. |
| **CEO**            | As a CEO, I want my app to be the top choice for jogging and exercise-related activities.        | Given the increasing demand for fitness apps, when users choose an app for jogging, then the app will have features that make it stand out, such as personalized routes and weather-based suggestions. |
| **Environmentalist**| As an environmentalist, I want the app to promote eco-friendly transportation options.         | Given the app’s route suggestions, when I plan my jogging routes, then the app will encourage more users to opt for walking or jogging instead of driving. |
